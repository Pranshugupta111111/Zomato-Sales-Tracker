# Zomato-Sales-Tracker
🚀 Project Name: Zomoto Sales and Customer Insights Dashboard

🔍 Objective: The goal of this project was to analyze Zomoto's sales data and customer behavior to uncover actionable insights that can drive growth, improve customer satisfaction, and optimize operations.

🔧 Process:

Data Cleaning & Transformation (removal of duplicates, handling missing values).
Data Modeling (relationships between tables for better insights).
Data Visualization and Analysis in Power BI.

📊 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):

Total Sales: Breakdown of monthly sales performance.
Customer Retention Rate: Analyzing repeat customer behavior.
Average Order Value (AOV): Identifying trends in customer spending.
Delivery Time: Measuring delivery performance and customer experience.
Customer Feedback: Insights from customer ratings and reviews.
💡 Problem Statement: Zomoto was facing challenges in understanding key factors driving customer satisfaction and sales performance. The objective was to identify trends in customer behavior, high-performing restaurants, and areas of operational inefficiency, specifically related to delivery times and customer feedback.

🔑 Key Insights:

High-Performing Regions: Certain regions consistently outperform in sales, indicating strong market penetration.
Delivery Time Impact: Late deliveries were directly linked to lower customer ratings, highlighting the need for operational improvements.
Customer Retention: Customers with high average order values tend to have a higher retention rate, but new customer acquisition is lagging.
Customer Preferences: Vegetarian options received better ratings than non-vegetarian items, providing an opportunity for targeted menu adjustments.
📈 Recommendations:

Improve Delivery Operations: Focus on reducing delivery times in underperforming regions through better resource allocation and route optimization.
Targeted Promotions: Increase retention efforts for new customers with tailored promotions based on order history and preferences.
Menu Optimization: Expand vegetarian menu offerings in regions where customer preferences lean towards healthier, plant-based options.
Customer Feedback Loops: Implement a system to quickly address negative feedback on deliveries and improve service recovery.
